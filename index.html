<h3><b>HTML // hypertext markup language</b></h3>
<p>HTML is what forms the web. It contains <b>text</b> (what you see) and <b>markup</b> (what determines how it looks)</p>
<u>TAGS </u>
<p><b>tags</b> are how a computer and a browser will read information the way we want it. Each tag means something else and is always enclosed by <>.
Most of the times we must place a tag at the beginning and close it at the end of the element you want to affect.</p>
some examples of tags are:
<BR> <em>b = bold
<BR>em = italic</BR>
a= anchors or links
<br> br= break</br></em>
<em>p= paragraph</em>

<p> we don't need to remember all these tags, they are easily found online in websites like
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com"> this one </a></p>

In order to incorporate links, images or video elements into our HTML, different tags and formulas
must be used. Find some examples <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp> here</a>

<p>some tags such as <em> break</em> or <em> paragraph</em > might have similar effects on content and text since
they both separate sentences bringing them to a different level. The difference is that the first one is called <u>inline</u> 
  while the last one is referred to as <u>block.</u></p>

  <u>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INLINE AND BLOCK</u>
<em><br>inline= breaks the text into a separate <b>line</b></br></em>
<em> block= breaks the text into a sort of <b>box</b> that can have a specific width and height</em>

<p>These are the basic elements, but a complete HTML would include a <em>doctype, html, head, title, body</em> and it will look something like <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp> this</a></p>
